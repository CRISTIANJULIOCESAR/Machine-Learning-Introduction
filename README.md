I will try to mix bioinformatics and Machine Learning. I know a lot from analyzing RNA-seq data. Expert in ncRNAs such as circRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNA, etc. 

But first, lest introduce you, this first chapter of this book call:
Introduction to Machine Learning with Python.
In this project,  we are creating our first Classifying iris species ok
so let's start!  I will explain the code for those who are not engineers in computer sciences.
